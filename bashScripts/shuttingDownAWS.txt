Stopping redis:
$ ./stopRedisDB.sh

Stopping Cassandra DBs:
in order for the bash script below to work you need to go into the stop-server file
within the /bin directory of Cassandra and uncomment the two lines:
(1) user=`whoami`
(2) pgrep -u $user -f cassandra | xargs kill -9

Now run the following bash script from local host:
$ ./stopCassandraDBs.sh

'kafka' is the name of my kafka cluster.
The general syntax for using peg to shutdown services is:
peg service <cluster-name> <service> stop
$ peg service kafka kafka stop
$ peg service kafka zookeeper stop

Stopping clusters (my cluster names are kafka and cassandra):
$ peg stop kafka
$ peg stop cassandra
